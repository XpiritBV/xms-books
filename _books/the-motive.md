 As he does in his other books, he then provides a straightforward summary of the lessons from the fable, combining a clear explanation of his theory with practical advice to help executives examine their true motivation for leading. In addition to provoking readers to honestly assess themselves, Lencioni presents action steps for changing their approach in five key areas.

*By Rene van Osnabrugge:*
When you work as a software engineer you make things. At the end of the day you can look at your code and think. Hey this is what I created. Something tangible. But, when moving to more "management" positions or to positions where you need to enable others, that "tangible" part is not always there. You are not making code, pipelines or something that is visible, but instead you are having discussion, conversations, coach people, reflect and challenge. This book is a very nice book about these challenges and how we all easily can fall into operational execution. Where we instead should focus on helping others to be more succesful. Have the hard conversation, do the hard work and lead.
