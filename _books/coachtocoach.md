Think about the coaches you've had throughout your life. Most likely, some were good, others not so good. Maybe one or two were great. One thing is undeniable: Coaches can influence your life in ways that can be negative or positive. A coach can either build you up or tear you down. The world needs better coaches in all walks of life--if you're a parent, a teacher, a co-worker, or a leader, you are also a coach. Which kind of coach do you want to be? Coach to Coach helps you answer this question and shares the secrets to bringing out the best in a person, both on and off the field.

# Why is this interesting for Xpirit

*By Rene van Osnabrugge:*
Being a consultant at Xpirit means that you are usually one the people that leads the team. That also means other people are led. And by that, you automatically become a coach. I think that by being a coach to receptive people you can enlarge your footprint. Show them what is possible, give them trust, show them good habits. And all of a sudden there are ambassodors in the team that say the same things as yourself. This book is very straightforward. Everything works right away, but the novel style and story is very nice. There are some very good inisghts in here that can really help you become a better coach to people in your team or organization
