Why are we different than other consultancy firms? This book provides the answer. This novel styled book is a story of the transformation of a consultant. How he discovers that 3 fears are withholding him and his customers to fulfill the full potential. The 3 fears are all about how we behave in certain situations and how it usually does not help to truly help a customer. This book perfectly describes how consultancy should be done in the eye of Xpirit.

# Why is this interesting for Xpirit

*By Rene van Osnabrugge:*
In my opinion the "bible" for Xpirit. The three fears, and how to overcome them are so relatable. Everyone has them and the people that face them and overcome them truly make the difference. We see all kinds of other consultants or freelancers keeping their head down. Staying safe because otherwise they might lose their business. They won't ask questions and make remarks because they might seem inadequate. We as Xpirit want to make impact, and you can only do that by facing the fears and challenge everything. This book is the perfect explanantion on our way of work. A must read!
