After more than 14 years of research with corporate change, the ADKAR model has emerged as a holistic approach that brings together the collection of change management work into a simple, results oriented model. This model ties together all aspects of change management including readiness assessments, sponsorship, communications, coaching, training and resistance management. All of these activities are placed into a framework that is oriented on the required phases for realizing change with individuals and the organization.

The ADKAR perspective can help you develop a "new lens" through which to observe and influence change. You may be working for change in your public school system or in a small city council. You may be sponsoring change in your department at work. You may be observing large changes that are being attempted at the highest levels of government or you may be leading an enterprise-wide change initiative. The perspective enabled by the ADKAR model allows you to view change in a new way. You can begin to see the barrier points and understand the levers that can move your changes forward. ADKAR allows you to understand why some changes succeed while others fail. Most importantly, ADKAR can help your changes be a success. Based on research with more than 2600 companies from 59 countries, ADKAR is a simple and holistic way to manage change.

*By Rene van Osnabrugge:*
We often get assignments where we need to change something. Sometimes it is something big, and sometimes it is something small. But with the cnage always comes human interaction and different responses in behavior. This model gives a lot of insights how change works for the receiving side. We as techies, we often start with sharing knowledge, teaching, giving examples. But as this model describes, if people are not even aware on the why and they do not have any desire to change, all this effort is futile. People won't register. By being aware of this model, and guiding people through the change process we can become more succesful.
