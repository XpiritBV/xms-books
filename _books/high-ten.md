This is a follow up on the coach to coach book. Where coach to coach focusses on teh indivudual this focusses on the team.

Building a great team culture doesn't happen overnight. Culture is hard to create, and even harder to change. Great culture is a key component for success at home, on the sports field, and at the workplace. In a time when people seem to be more divided than ever, leaders who can build strong and lasting cultures are essential. 

This engaging, easy-to-read parable shows you that every business, sports team, and family has a culture. Whether you deliberately created it or not, it's always there and it didn’t come with a manual. That's where High Ten comes in. This must-have book is your personal leadership manual. Stop spending your day unhappy or complaining about a dream that hasn’t come true. High Ten will help you:

* Create an environment where your people work towards common goals with friends they trust—have fun doing it
* Develop clarity about the culture you want and put the processes in place to make it happen
* Ensure your culture reflects core values and aligns with your organization’s mission and vision
* Transform your culture into the "immune system" for your team or business
* Learn about the "3 Cornerstones of Culture" and eliminate the "5 Culture Killers"
